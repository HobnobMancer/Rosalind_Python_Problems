# Rosalind_Python_Problems
Store of Python files containing solutions to problems from Rosalind


This repository contains the Python files created to solve the problems on the Rosalind website: http://rosalind.info/problems/list-view/

Each problem has it's own Python file, with both possessing the same name.

Python = 3.7
Aconda:
	autopep8
	bandit
	black
	flake8
	mypy
	pycodestyle
	pydocstyle
	pylint

Problems are culminated in two groups:
Python Village - introduction problems covering basic Python concepts (dinstriguished by file names starting with INIn when 'n' is a number)
Python Stronghold - more complex problems, with a biological context requiring the solver to identify the necessary Python elements needed to solve the problem
