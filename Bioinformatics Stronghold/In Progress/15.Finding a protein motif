# Given: At most 15 UniProt Protein Database access IDs.
# Return: For each protein possessing the N-glycosylation motif, output its given access ID followed by a list of locations in the protein string where the motif can be found.

# take IDs and add into http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/id-here.fasta
# N-glycosylaion motif: N{P}[ST]{P}.
# when {+} means any amino acid except +
# and when [+ =] means with amino acid + or =

# Example output:
# B5ZC00
# 85 118 142 306 395



# Prepare Data
# open file with read only permit, read line by line
# Open file containing UniProt IDs, and assign IDs to a variable (uniprotIDs)
